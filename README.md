SillyMan0108 presents his greatest mod to date: the old, removed and newer features mod. Started in early 2018, he aimed for it to simply add back old and removed features. However, since then, he has expanded it into including old removed and newer features, hence the name. More info coming, so please stay tuned for more!

Requires Forge 25.0.219 and Minecraft 1.13.2.
